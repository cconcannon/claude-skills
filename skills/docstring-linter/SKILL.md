# Python Docstring Linter

To ensure Python codebases maintain high-quality documentation, use this skill to automatically detect and fix missing or improperly formatted docstrings.

## Overview

This skill provides an automated workflow for:
1. Scanning Python files in a codebase
2. Identifying docstring issues (missing or improperly formatted)
3. Fixing the identified issues
4. Recursively re-running the linter until all issues are resolved

## Available Tools

**Helper Script**:
- `scripts/lint-docstrings.py` - Automated docstring checker that generates a report

**Always run the script first** to understand the current state of docstrings in the codebase before attempting fixes.

## Docstring Standards Enforced

The linter checks for:

1. **Presence**: All public modules, classes, functions, and methods must have docstrings
   - Private methods (starting with single underscore `_`) are exempt
   - Dunder methods (starting/ending with `__`) require docstrings

2. **Capitalization**: Docstrings must start with a capital letter (if starting with alphabetic character)

3. **Punctuation**: Single-line docstrings must end with a period

4. **Non-empty**: Docstrings cannot be empty or contain only whitespace

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Scan

To begin the docstring linting process:

1. **Run the linter script** from the repository root:
   ```bash
   python scripts/lint-docstrings.py
   ```

2. **Review the generated report**: The script creates `TODO_DOCSTRINGS.md` in the current directory, containing:
   - List of files with issues
   - Line numbers and specific problems
   - Total count of issues

3. **Analyze the scope**: Read the report to understand:
   - Which files need attention
   - Types of issues (missing vs. formatting)
   - Overall magnitude of work

### Phase 2: Systematic Fixing

To fix the identified issues systematically:

1. **Process files one at a time** from the report:
   - Read the file to understand context
   - Fix each issue identified for that file
   - Use the Edit tool to make precise changes

2. **Apply appropriate fixes** based on issue type:

   **For missing docstrings:**
   - Analyze the code to understand purpose
   - Write clear, concise docstrings that explain:
     - What the module/class/function does
     - Parameters (with types if not obvious)
     - Return values (with types if not obvious)
     - Any important side effects or exceptions
   - Follow Google or NumPy docstring style conventions

   **For formatting issues:**
   - Capitalize first letter if needed
   - Add terminal period for single-line docstrings
   - Ensure docstring is not empty

3. **Maintain existing style**: When adding docstrings to a codebase:
   - Match the existing docstring format (Google, NumPy, or reStructuredText style)
   - Mirror the level of detail used in existing docstrings
   - Follow any project-specific conventions observed

### Phase 3: Iterative Verification

After making fixes, verify the changes:

1. **Re-run the linter**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/lint-docstrings.py
   ```

2. **Check the updated report**: Compare against previous run:
   - Verify fixed files no longer appear
   - Identify any new issues introduced
   - Confirm total issue count decreased

3. **Continue iteration**: If issues remain:
   - Return to Phase 2 to fix remaining problems
   - Repeat until the linter reports: "âœ… No issues found!"

### Phase 4: Completion

To finalize the docstring improvements:

1. **Verify clean report**: Confirm the linter exits with success status (exit code 0)

2. **Clean up**: Remove the `TODO_DOCSTRINGS.md` file if desired:
   ```bash
   rm TODO_DOCSTRINGS.md
   ```

3. **Summary**: Report to the user:
   - Total files processed
   - Total issues fixed
   - Confirmation that all docstrings now meet standards

## Example Docstring Formats

### Module-level Docstring
```python
"""Utilities for processing user authentication and authorization."""
```

### Class Docstring
```python
class UserManager:
    """Manages user accounts and authentication state.

    Handles user creation, authentication, and session management
    for the application.
    """
```

### Function/Method Docstring (Simple)
```python
def calculate_total(items: List[Item]) -> float:
    """Calculate the total price of all items including tax."""
```

### Function/Method Docstring (Detailed)
```python
def process_payment(amount: float, currency: str) -> PaymentResult:
    """Process a payment transaction.

    Args:
        amount: Payment amount in the specified currency.
        currency: ISO 4217 currency code (e.g., "USD", "EUR").

    Returns:
        PaymentResult containing transaction ID and status.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If amount is negative or currency is invalid.
        PaymentError: If payment processing fails.
    """
```

## Script Behavior

The `lint-docstrings.py` script:
- Recursively scans all `.py` files in the current directory
- Skips common directories: `.git`, `__pycache__`, `.venv`, `venv`, `.tox`, `build`, `dist`, `.eggs`
- Generates a markdown report with all issues
- Exits with code 1 if issues found, 0 if all checks pass
- Can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: "Missing module-level docstring"**
- Solution: Add a docstring at the very top of the file (line 1) describing the module's purpose

**Issue: "Docstring should start with capital letter"**
- Solution: Capitalize the first alphabetic character in the docstring

**Issue: "Single-line docstring should end with a period"**
- Solution: Add a period at the end of single-line docstrings

**Issue: "Empty docstring"**
- Solution: Replace empty triple-quotes with meaningful documentation
